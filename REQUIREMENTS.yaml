      - Staff totals match before/after within rounding error
      - Baseline comparison report generated showing 0.0 difference in metrics
      - Migration creates tables but does not modify existing enrollment/staff data

    type: constraint
    priority: should
    status: implemented
    acceptance_criteria:
      - When year and quality are equal, prefer NCES CCD over SEA data for consistency
      - Use ST_LEAID from NCES for state identifier crosswalk
      - State-specific tables provide enhancement, not replacement
      - Accept 1-2 year data lag typical of federal reporting
      - Infrastructure ready for state-specific enhancements without schema changes

    description: Data source precedence for enrollment and staffing
    type: constraint
    priority: must
    status: tested
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Precedence order - Year-matched NCES > Year-matched SEA > Older NCES > Older SEA
      - Year-matched NCES preferred for standardization and cross-state comparability
      - Recency trumps source when year differs (newer NCES beats older SEA)
      - StaffCountsEffective tracks primary_source and sources_used for transparency
      - EnrollmentByGrade tracks data_source for lineage
      - When merging sources, document decision in quality_notes or method_notes
