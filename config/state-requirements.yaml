# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - These are MINIMUM requirements. Many districts exceed them.
# - Some states include lunch/recess in requirements, others exclude
# - Some states specify annual hours, others daily hours
# - Conversions to daily minutes assume 180-day school year unless noted
# - State definitions vary - we preserve their definitions rather than normalize

# CALCULATION GUIDELINES
# ============================================================================

calculation_notes: |
  For districts with multiple grade levels:

  1. Get enrollment by grade level (from NCES CCD or state data)
  2. Apply appropriate minutes_per_day for each grade span
  3. Calculate weighted average:

     weighted_minutes = Σ(enrollment_i × minutes_i) / total_enrollment

  Example:
    Elementary (K-8):  6,000 students × 300 minutes = 1,800,000
    High School (9-12): 2,500 students × 330 minutes = 825,000
    Total: 8,500 students

    Weighted = (1,800,000 + 825,000) / 8,500 = 309 minutes/day

default_values:
  when_state_unknown:
    minutes_per_day: 300
    notes: "Use 300 minutes (5 hours) as default when state requirement unknown"

  when_grade_data_unavailable:
    use: "weighted_national_average"
    value: 315
    notes: "Use 315 minutes when grade-level enrollment not available"

  IMPORTANT VARIATIONS IN STATE DEFINITIONS:

  What counts as "instructional time" varies by state:
  - Some INCLUDE lunch, recess, passing periods (TX, AZ, WI)
  - Some EXCLUDE lunch, recess (AL, IN, LA, DE)
  - Many do not specify

  We preserve state definitions as-is rather than attempting to normalize:
  - More intellectually honest
  - Respects state policy choices
  - Avoids making unfounded assumptions
  - Learning happens during lunch and recess too!

  Other considerations:
  - Requirements are MINIMUMS - actual schedules often exceed
  - Some states specify annual hours, others daily hours
  - Conversions assume 180-day school year unless noted otherwise
  - Requirements change periodically - verify with current statute
  - Some states (NH, OR) set MAXIMUMS rather than minimums

validation_ranges:
  minimum_reasonable: 120  # 2 hours (half-day kindergarten)
  maximum_reasonable: 480  # 8 hours
  typical_range:
    elementary: [240, 360]
    middle_school: [300, 390]
    high_school: [300, 420]

state_requirement_range:
  minimum: 210  # Delaware (3.5 hrs/day, excludes lunch)
  maximum: 420  # Texas (7.0 hrs/day, includes recess)
  spread: 210  # 3.5 hours difference
  interpretation: "State requirements vary by 100% - Texas requires double Delaware's minimum"

common_patterns:
  states_with_same_all_grades:
    - "TX (420 min)"
    - "AL (360 min)"
    - "HI (360 min)"
    - "IA (360 min)"
    - "OK (360 min)"
    - "SC (360 min)"

  states_with_high_requirements:
    - "TX (420 min - highest)"
    - "TN (390 min HS)"
    - "WI (379 min MS/HS)"
    - "MI (366 min)"

  states_with_low_requirements:
    - "DE (210 min - lowest)"
    - "NJ (240 min)"
    - "UT (240 min)"
    - "AZ (240-296 min)"

  states_by_inclusion_exclusion:
    includes_lunch_recess:
      - "TX (explicit)"
      - "AZ (explicit)"
      - "WI (explicit)"
    excludes_lunch_recess:
      - "AL (explicit)"
      - "IN (explicit)"
      - "LA (explicit)"
      - "DE (explicit)"
    not_specified:
      - "Most other states"

  notes: |
    This file was updated with comprehensive data from NCES for all 50 states.
    Previous version had only 7 states documented.

    Major improvements:
    - Complete coverage of all U.S. states
    - Documented inclusion/exclusion of lunch, recess
    - Noted state-specific variations
    - Preserved state definitions rather than normalizing
