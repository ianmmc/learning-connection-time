# Calculation Guidelines

calculation_notes: |
  For districts with multiple grade levels:
  
  1. Get enrollment by grade level (from NCES CCD or state data)
  2. Apply appropriate minutes_per_day for each grade span
  3. Calculate weighted average:
     
     weighted_minutes = Σ(enrollment_i × minutes_i) / total_enrollment
  
  Example:
    Elementary (K-8):  6,000 students × 200 minutes = 1,200,000
    High School (9-12): 2,500 students × 360 minutes = 900,000
    Total: 8,500 students
    
    Weighted = (1,200,000 + 900,000) / 8,500 = 247 minutes/day

default_values:
  when_state_unknown:
    minutes_per_day: 300
    notes: "Use 300 minutes (5 hours) as default when state requirement unknown"
  
  when_grade_data_unavailable:
    use: "weighted_national_average"
    value: 315
    notes: "Use 315 minutes when grade-level enrollment not available"

common_patterns:
  elementary_range: "240-300 minutes"
  middle_school_range: "300-360 minutes"
  high_school_range: "330-420 minutes"
  
  states_with_same_all_grades:
    - "TX (420)"
    - "OH (303)"
  
  states_with_grade_variation:
    - "CA (200 elem, 360 HS)"
    - "NY (300 elem, 330 middle/HS)"
    - "FL (240 K-3, 300 4-12)"

data_quality_notes: |
  - Requirements are MINIMUMS - actual schedules often exceed
  - Some states specify annual hours, others daily hours
  - Lunch, recess may or may not count as "instructional time"
  - Conversions assume 180-day school year where not specified
  - Requirements change periodically - verify with current statute

validation_ranges:
  minimum_reasonable: 180  # 3 hours
  maximum_reasonable: 480  # 8 hours
  typical_range:
    elementary: [240, 300]
    middle_school: [300, 360]
    high_school: [330, 420]
