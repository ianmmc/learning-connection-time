# Claude Code Project Briefing: Learning Connection Time

This is the first thing a fresh Claude Code session sees. It's a navigation hub + durable operating rules —
not a build log. For *why* this project exists, read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`; for *what's built right
now*, read GitHub Issues (this repo uses them as the live tracker) — this file stays short on purpose so it
doesn't need constant rewriting.

## Project Mission

Transform student-to-teacher ratios into "Learning Connection Time" (LCT) metrics that tell the story of students getting shortchanged.

**Core Formula:**
```
LCT = (Daily Instructional Minutes × Instructional Staff) / Student Enrollment
```

**Example:** 5,000 students, 250 teachers, 360 min/day → LCT = 18 min/student/day

**Goal:** Analyze data from the largest U.S. school districts to identify educational equity disparities.
Full mission, reframe, and 6-phase roadmap: `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Currently in **Phase 1.5**: enriching
basic LCT with actual bell schedules acquired via the 9-stage acquisition pipeline
(`docs/ACQUISITION_PIPELINE.md`). Known methodological limitations (individualization fallacy,
time-as-quality assumption, averaging deception): `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`.

## Durable pipeline facts (settled architecture — rarely changes; NOT current-status)

**Metric = GROSS bell-to-bell minutes (end − start), NOT net.** No lunch/passing/recess deduction, no
*assumed* deductions. Ground truth is already gross; gross needs only two reliably-published numbers
(↑accuracy). Net is a deferred enhancement. Labeled `gross_bell_to_bell`. Plausibility gate 240–510 min.
(REQ-055; supersedes net in REQ-042/046.)

**INVARIANT — extractors read TIMES; deterministic code computes MINUTES + the MODE.** Council models
return only per-school `{start_time,end_time,grade_level,school_name}` facts; Python does `gross=end−start`
and the per-band exact-mode. Never ask a model to compute minutes or pick a "typical" schedule. (REQ-054.)

**Extraction = COUNCIL (correctness); Discovery = WAVES (recall).** Council: consensus is on the per-school
(start,end) pair, cross-family, ±15 min — same-family agreement is NOT consensus (REQ-056). Council
template: 2 cross-family voters → a 3rd-family judge on disagreement, enforced in `councils.validate()`.
Model composition is deferred to the council lab (`cost_benchmark`), never guessed. Discovery = a
deterministic SERP cascade, NOT agent waves: Wave 1 = Bright Data SERP + Serper failover (real Google
index) → Wave 2 = Claude WebSearch on the residual (a different index, speculative). The index predicts
recall — raw Google wins; own-index providers crater on long-tail K-12.

**The DB is the working store; disk holds binaries + receipts.** The governance Postgres DB is what every
stage actually reads/writes; per-stage JSON files (`discovery.json`, `filtered.json`, `handoff_*.json`,
etc.) are regenerable, auditable receipts — never the transport between stages.

**Human-in-the-loop gates are stage-numbered:** `gate@1` (Queue) · `gate@5` (Filter — the critical
per-URL review gate) · `gate@6` (Dispatch) · `gate@7` (Extract) · `gate@8` (Aggregate — Stage 9 then
auto-writes). Stages 2/3/4 + the Stage-9 write are ungated. Each gate is manual/auto (confidence-escalating).

**Ramp-up model (standing operating posture):** the pipeline is built **high-supervision-first** — every
gate manual now, easing toward auto (confidence-escalating) only as each gate's reliability is proven;
the destination is a self-governing app. **So present gate output as a recommendation for human sign-off,
not a done deal, until that gate is explicitly set to auto** — the human inspects real output at each gate
and catches real-data bugs code review misses. (governance §11b.)

**Three batch types (Stage 1):** `first-run`, `follow-up`, and `benchmark` (the 27 curated-GT districts
injected as `batch_00000` — permanently walled off from Stage-9 writes and funnel/enrichment stats; see
`STAGE1_QUEUE_DESIGN.md` §2h).

**Ground truth, hand-verified (gross, per-school):** `data/benchmark/gt_curation_*/gt_proposals.json` —
940/943 schools human-verified across `batch_00000`'s 27 districts. Process: council *proposes*, human
*verifies* (REQ-059). **This set is FIXED — gate@8 approvals do NOT append to it** (no such code path;
Stage 9, the writer, is unbuilt — #93). What grows is the **confirmed-fact base**: every district approved
at gate@8 accrues a `stage8_approval` row + a frozen closing-argument receipt, and the more confirmed facts
we hold, the more we have to *learn from and improve with* — realized as pipeline-improvement work (epics
#478/#119, continuing in #106), not as a write into the GT corpus (Ian, 2026-07-16).

**Reader-routing (format-route the reader, outcome-based):** Tier 1 plain text → Tier 2 `page.pdf()` +
`pdftotext -layout` (multi-column) → Tier 2.5 OCR a clean image → Tier 3 vision (reads JS/image/scan pages
all text paths miss). Trigger is "did the cheap reader recover usable content," not format.

**SEA central-data harvest is a dead end for daily minutes** (verified) — states publish only statutory
minimums / day-counts, not actual daily minutes. Web discovery + extraction is the primary acquisition
path. See `INSTRUCTIONAL_TIME_HARVEST.md`.

**Notes:** Local Ollama deleted; paid-cloud extraction is cheap (~$0.05–0.30/1M). Keys in gitignored
`config/secrets.local.json` + `.env`. Requirements are tracked as REQ-001…151 in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.yaml`
(some numbers superseded/retired — see that file's own status column, not a list here).

## Fresh-session essentials

`/catchup` → `pip install -e .` → **Docker up** (`docker-compose up -d`) → `lint-imports` (expect "kept/0
broken") + `pytest -q -m "not integration"`. `build_signals` full re-ingest (~2.5 min, idempotent, preserves
labels/facets) is only needed after a scoring/config change or new captures — not just to reboot the app.

Console: `python3 -m infrastructure.acquisition.process_governance.server` (→ :8005; Stage 5 default).
**Reload the browser for `static/*.js`, restart the server for Python changes.** Self-verify UI changes with
Playwright before shipping visuals (Python playwright isn't installed — drive the Node one in
`infrastructure/scraper`). CI runs two jobs: the DB-free suite + `governance-db` (`pytest -m govdb` on a
Postgres service container).

**Precious state + backups:** `label` (incl. `facets_json`) / `cluster_split` / `followup_flag` /
`handoff` + the gate@8 human-judgment tables (`stage8_approval` incl. frozen receipts, `band_exclusion`,
`human_added_fact`, `slot_assignment`, `gate_mode`) live in the governance DB;
`handoff_<hash>_<ts>.json` under `data/acquisition/handoffs/` is immutable; `saved_view` holds UI prefs.
The tracked `.githooks/pre-commit` sweeps the git-backed JSON twins (`labels.json`,
`district_status.json`, `stage8_approvals.json`, `band_exclusions.json`, `human_added_facts.json`,
`slot_assignments.json`, …) into every commit — on a fresh clone run `git config core.hooksPath
.githooks` (`GETTING_STARTED.md` §1b). Stage 4 needs poppler/tesseract/ghostscript
(`GETTING_STARTED.md` §1a).

**Current status (2026-07-22): two threads in flight — the Stage 9 campaign (6 of 38 incorporated) and
a documentation-driven receipts hardening effort (REQ-164), the latter on an unmerged branch.** Stage 9:
continuing one-district-at-a-time, Santa Fe/Gallup/Las Cruces NM joined the 3 already incorporated
(32 pending; the approved total grew 22→38 as more districts cleared gate@8 mid-session). Gallup's
secondary LCT fell back to statutory — root-caused to NCES suppressing its 2024-25 staff report, not a
bug (`#613`, a policy question: Ian leans against widening the REQ-026 window). A pre-emptive scan of the
pending districts found one more latent case (Dickinson 1 ND — a genuinely stale 2016-17 source, needs
re-extraction, not a policy fix). That investigation led to a broader question — "why don't stages 6-9
get per-district receipts like 1-5?" — which turned up two real, smaller gaps (`#614` console progress
view, `#615` Stage-9's `district_grade_minutes` has no git twin + `district_status.json` lags gate@8/9)
plus a `cache_ingest` disk-re-read follow-up (`#616`). This produced **REQ-164** (`must`) + the four
commandments as testable **REQ-165…168** — built so far on branch `feat/pipeline-receipts-req164`
(NOT merged): `common/receipts.py` (the shared always-stamped writer) + Stage 9/8/6/7 per-district
audit receipts + in-path `district_status.json` twin refresh, all tested. Separately, the whole doc tower
got a reorganization (3 files → `docs/state-integrations/`, a `learning-loop-reports/` dir created,
`refactor-20260123/` → `infrastructure/quality-assurance/`, the fable review → `docs/archive/`) and a
5-way parallel accuracy sync (`DATABASE_SETUP.md`'s schema had drifted — two fictional tables, several
wrong column names — plus a cluster of stale "Stage 8/9 isn't built" doc residue), both landed directly
on `main`. Full narrative: `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`'s three 2026-07-22 entries; `docs/REQUIREMENTS.yaml`
REQ-002/REQ-162/REQ-163 (main) + REQ-164/REQ-165…168 (feat branch only).

**Next (RESUME HERE — 2026-07-22): two independent threads to resume, either order.**
**(1) Stage 9 campaign** — continue incorporating the remaining 32 gate@8-approved districts one at a
time (dry-run → incorporate → `per_grade_lct_sample.py` preview → review); watch for Dickinson 1 ND
(`3800038` — stale 2016-17 middle-school source, re-extract before incorporating) and any other
staff-vintage cases like Gallup's (`#613` — expected rare, not yet a systemic pattern). Once all pending
districts are in and previews look right, run the one-time `lct_calculations` recompute
(`calculate_lct_variants.py`'s write path — a no-op for non-incorporated districts); spot-check
`teachers_secondary` against the preview, confirm `data_tier`/`instructional_minutes_source`, watch for
`denom_refreshed` districts.
**(2) REQ-164 receipts work** (`git checkout feat/pipeline-receipts-req164`) — Phase 5b (declare all 9
stages in `arch-manifest.json` + the both-ways coverage fitness test, now addable green since 6-9 exist)
→ Phase 3 (convert stages 2/4/5 + benchmark to always-stamped; the Node/Python receipt convention as a
declared cross-language contract per `POLYGLOT_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE_TOOLCHAIN.md`; repoint `cache_ingest`
per `#616`) → Phase 4 (gov_db-`state_event`-sourced legacy-receipt backfill script) → Phase 5c (concluding
doc-tower update: `PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE.md` §1's receipt taxonomy, `ACQUISITION_PIPELINE.md`,
the per-stage design notes, `CLAUDE.md`, the POLYGLOT doc).
Banked routing: #112 → epic #128. Parked: #475/#476, #103/#80 (+#110); SEA integration follow-up (the
~9-state list from the 2026-07-20/21 campaign) is an opt-in backlog item, not yet filed as an issue —
ask Ian before filing if it should be tracked now or deferred.
Documented-in-code deferrals: `_satisfied_bands_now` batching (revisit on volume); the #522
guardrail's per-rep keyword/table attribution (needs a server payload change); JS behavioral tests
(no JS harness in repo — static-source pins only); the remediation-receipt exception is not
STAGE-scoped (time-bound 30-day expiry since 2026-07-20; revisit if remediation volume grows);
attribution v1 reads each district's LATEST candidate plan (documented in-module).
Resume-essentials: `pip install -e .` → Docker up (`docker-compose up -d`) → `git config
core.hooksPath .githooks` (fresh clone only) → `lint-imports` (expect **4 kept/0 broken**) + `pytest -q
-m "not integration"` (expect **1905** pass, 1 skipped [pyarrow]) + `pytest -q -m govdb` (expect
**327**, Postgres up) + `pytest tests/test_*_integration.py` (expect **247** pass, 149 skipped, live
DB) + `cd infrastructure/scraper && npm test` (expect **90**). On the receipts branch, also
`pytest tests/test_receipts.py` (15 pass) + the stage6/7/8/9 suites.
Console: reload the browser for `static/*.js`; Playwright-verify UI work against REAL records (the
motivating ones: Huntington `4824000:af06722adb` 333k-char handbook; `0602095:6e8db3e114` 258 rasters).
Stage 9 incorporate CLI: `python -m infrastructure.acquisition.stage9_incorporate <did> [--dry-run]`;
sign-off preview: `python -m infrastructure.scripts.analyze.per_grade_lct_sample`.
Full detail: `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`, `STAGE1-9_*_DESIGN.md`, `PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE.md`,

## Current Data Years

**Current School Year:** derived automatically (July-1 rollover) by
`infrastructure/utilities/school_year.py:current_school_year()` — the single source of truth,
never hand-bumped (2026-27 as of this writing). `NCES_PRIMARY_YEAR` in the same module IS
hand-bumped, on ingest of a new CCD (a data event), verified against `lct_calculations` rows.

### Data Year Strategy

| Data Type | Year | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Primary dataset | 2024-25 | NCES CCD enrollment/staffing (ingested + LCT-calculated 2026-07) |
| Bell schedules | current → 2023-24 | Post-COVID acceptable, search current first; the REQ-026 blend window (span ≤ 2 start-years) arbitrates per calculation |
| COVID exclusion | 2019-20 through 2022-23 | Never use - abnormal schedules |

**Search Order:** current school year first, then back to 2023-24 (all post-COVID)

---

## Database Quick Reference

```bash
# Bell schedule count (source of truth)
python3 -c "
from infrastructure.database.connection import session_scope
from sqlalchemy import text
with session_scope() as s:
    print(s.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district_id) FROM bell_schedules')).scalar())
"

# Query enrichment status
python -c "
from infrastructure.database.connection import session_scope
from infrastructure.database.queries import print_enrichment_report
with session_scope() as session:
    print_enrichment_report(session)
"
```

**Key Tables:** `districts`, `bell_schedules`, `state_requirements`, `lct_calculations`, `state_district_crosswalk`

---

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Calculate LCT (recommended)
python3 infrastructure/scripts/analyze/calculate_lct_variants.py

# Run SEA integration tests
pytest tests/test_*_integration.py -v

# VERIFICATION - Run after enrichment!
python3 infrastructure/scripts/verify_enrichment.py --quick
```

### Architecture & code-exploration tools (use these to read/verify the codebase — REQ-098)
These are installed (dev-deps) and are the project's standard way to map dependencies and enforce
layering — reach for them before writing or verifying any "what depends on what" narrative:
```bash
lint-imports                 # enforce the acquisition layering contracts (config: pyproject.toml); expect "4 kept, 0 broken"
python3 -c "import grimp; g=grimp.build_graph('infrastructure'); \
  print(sorted(g.find_modules_directly_imported_by('infrastructure.acquisition.stage1_queue.queue_batch')))"
                             # grimp: query the real import graph (what a module imports / is imported by)
vulture infrastructure/acquisition    # dead-code sweep
cd infrastructure/scraper && npm run lint:deps   # Node (.mjs) side — depcruise over the flat *.mjs (no lib/ dir)
pytest tests/test_arch_manifest.py    # cross-boundary FITNESS functions vs arch-manifest.json (#124)
```
> **Caveat (the recurring lesson):** the import tools see **Python/Node imports only**. They do NOT see the
> *environmental* dependencies that often matter most — NCES CSV files read by path/year, **LCT DB
> tables** accessed via the ORM, `subprocess`/`claude -p` calls, OpenRouter API hosts. After the import
> graph, **read the code** for those edges. (Toolchain rationale: `PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE.md` §10.)
> **`arch-manifest.json` + `tests/test_arch_manifest.py` (#124) now close part of this gap:** the declared
> ground truth for the cross-boundary edges (external processes, guarded entry points, client↔server rule
> literals, stage receipts), enforced as fitness functions. **When you add such an edge, update the manifest**
> — that edit is the review surface, and the suite fails on an undeclared one.

## Load Additional Context When Needed

This is the core briefing. Load the right doc for the task:

| Context Needed | Load File |
|----------------|-----------|
| Decisions, lessons, history | `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` |
| Dev setup, workflow, testing, commands, conventions | `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` |
| Database setup + schema | `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` (schema authority = `infrastructure/database/models.py`) |
| Data sources, SEA integrations, ID crosswalks, complex districts | `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` · `SEA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` |
| Data methodology (LCT, sampling, exclusions, temporal) | `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` |
| The acquisition pipeline + per-stage design notes | `docs/ACQUISITION_PIPELINE.md` (map) → `docs/technical-notes/acquisition-pipeline-stage-design-notes/STAGE*_DESIGN.md` |
| Governance / state model / gate model / console | `docs/technical-notes/PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE.md` |

**Token Efficiency:** load only what the task needs.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Docker Required**: Always use `docker-compose up -d` before database operations. Never use `brew services start postgresql` - the `.env` is configured for Docker's PostgreSQL container.
2. **COVID Data Exclusion**: Never use 2019-20 through 2022-23 data
3. **Security Blocks**: ONE-attempt rule for Cloudflare/WAF-protected districts
4. **Temporal Validation**: Data from multiple sources must span ≤3 years
5. **Raw Data**: Never modify files in `data/raw/`
6. **Data Verification**: ALWAYS verify data exists in database before claiming enrichment counts. Never trust dispatch documentation without database verification.
7. **Research before implementing**: When a task involves a non-trivial design decision, an unfamiliar
   failure mode, or a pattern this codebase hasn't established a convention for (state-machine/invariant
   design, a new library, a class of bug just hit), do a web search *before* writing code — not only
   after a bug or a code-review finding surfaces it. Goal: prevention over correction — spend a small,
   cheap search now to avoid a larger token/time cost fixing it later (a wrong implementation, a review
   round-trip, a CI failure). Cite what you found and how it shaped the approach, the same as any other
   research. This does not replace reading this codebase's own conventions first (CLAUDE.md, the
   `docs/technical-notes/` design notes, existing code in the area) — check those before an external
   search, since a local precedent usually beats a generic pattern.
