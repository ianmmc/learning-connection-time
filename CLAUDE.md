# Claude Code Project Briefing: Learning Connection Time

This is the first thing a fresh Claude Code session sees. It's a navigation hub + durable operating rules —
not a build log. For *why* this project exists, read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`; for *what's built right
now*, read GitHub Issues (this repo uses them as the live tracker) — this file stays short on purpose so it
doesn't need constant rewriting.

## Project Mission

Transform student-to-teacher ratios into "Learning Connection Time" (LCT) metrics that tell the story of students getting shortchanged.

**Core Formula:**
```
LCT = (Daily Instructional Minutes × Instructional Staff) / Student Enrollment
```

**Example:** 5,000 students, 250 teachers, 360 min/day → LCT = 18 min/student/day

**Goal:** Analyze data from the largest U.S. school districts to identify educational equity disparities.
Full mission, reframe, and 6-phase roadmap: `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Currently in **Phase 1.5**: enriching
basic LCT with actual bell schedules acquired via the 9-stage acquisition pipeline
(`docs/ACQUISITION_PIPELINE.md`). Known methodological limitations (individualization fallacy,
time-as-quality assumption, averaging deception): `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`.

## Durable pipeline facts (settled architecture — rarely changes; NOT current-status)

**Metric = GROSS bell-to-bell minutes (end − start), NOT net.** No lunch/passing/recess deduction, no
*assumed* deductions. Ground truth is already gross; gross needs only two reliably-published numbers
(↑accuracy). Net is a deferred enhancement. Labeled `gross_bell_to_bell`. Plausibility gate 240–510 min.
(REQ-055; supersedes net in REQ-042/046.)

**INVARIANT — extractors read TIMES; deterministic code computes MINUTES + the MODE.** Council models
return only per-school `{start_time,end_time,grade_level,school_name}` facts; Python does `gross=end−start`
and the per-band exact-mode. Never ask a model to compute minutes or pick a "typical" schedule. (REQ-054.)

**Extraction = COUNCIL (correctness); Discovery = WAVES (recall).** Council: consensus is on the per-school
(start,end) pair, cross-family, ±15 min — same-family agreement is NOT consensus (REQ-056). Council
template: 2 cross-family voters → a 3rd-family judge on disagreement, enforced in `councils.validate()`.
Model composition is deferred to the council lab (`cost_benchmark`), never guessed. Discovery = a
deterministic SERP cascade, NOT agent waves: Wave 1 = Bright Data SERP + Serper failover (real Google
index) → Wave 2 = Claude WebSearch on the residual (a different index, speculative). The index predicts
recall — raw Google wins; own-index providers crater on long-tail K-12.

**The DB is the working store; disk holds binaries + receipts.** The governance Postgres DB is what every
stage actually reads/writes; per-stage JSON files (`discovery.json`, `filtered.json`, `handoff_*.json`,
etc.) are regenerable, auditable receipts — never the transport between stages.

**Human-in-the-loop gates are stage-numbered:** `gate@1` (Queue) · `gate@5` (Filter — the critical
per-URL review gate) · `gate@6` (Dispatch) · `gate@7` (Extract) · `gate@8` (Aggregate — Stage 9 then
auto-writes). Stages 2/3/4 + the Stage-9 write are ungated. Each gate is manual/auto (confidence-escalating).

**Ramp-up model (standing operating posture):** the pipeline is built **high-supervision-first** — every
gate manual now, easing toward auto (confidence-escalating) only as each gate's reliability is proven;
the destination is a self-governing app. **So present gate output as a recommendation for human sign-off,
not a done deal, until that gate is explicitly set to auto** — the human inspects real output at each gate
and catches real-data bugs code review misses. (governance §11b.)

**Three batch types (Stage 1):** `first-run`, `follow-up`, and `benchmark` (the 27 curated-GT districts
injected as `batch_00000` — permanently walled off from Stage-9 writes and funnel/enrichment stats; see
`STAGE1_QUEUE_DESIGN_2026-06.md` §2h).

**Ground truth, hand-verified (gross, per-school):** `data/benchmark/gt_curation_*/gt_proposals.json` —
940/943 schools human-verified. Process: council *proposes*, human *verifies* (REQ-059).

**Reader-routing (format-route the reader, outcome-based):** Tier 1 plain text → Tier 2 `page.pdf()` +
`pdftotext -layout` (multi-column) → Tier 2.5 OCR a clean image → Tier 3 vision (reads JS/image/scan pages
all text paths miss). Trigger is "did the cheap reader recover usable content," not format.

**SEA central-data harvest is a dead end for daily minutes** (verified) — states publish only statutory
minimums / day-counts, not actual daily minutes. Web discovery + extraction is the primary acquisition
path. See `docs/INSTRUCTIONAL_TIME_HARVEST.md`.

**Notes:** Local Ollama deleted; paid-cloud extraction is cheap (~$0.05–0.30/1M). Keys in gitignored
`config/secrets.local.json` + `.env`. Requirements are tracked as REQ-001…115+ in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.yaml`
(some numbers superseded/retired — see that file's own status column, not a list here).

## Fresh-session essentials

`/catchup` → `pip install -e .` → **Docker up** (`docker-compose up -d`) → `lint-imports` (expect "kept/0
broken") + `pytest -q -m "not integration"`. `build_signals` full re-ingest (~2.5 min, idempotent, preserves
labels/facets) is only needed after a scoring/config change or new captures — not just to reboot the app.

Console: `python3 -m infrastructure.acquisition.process_governance.server` (→ :8005; Stage 5 default).
**Reload the browser for `static/*.js`, restart the server for Python changes.** Self-verify UI changes with
Playwright before shipping visuals (Python playwright isn't installed — drive the Node one in
`infrastructure/scraper`). CI runs two jobs: the DB-free suite + `governance-db` (`pytest -m govdb` on a
Postgres service container).

**Precious state + backups:** `label` (incl. `facets_json`) / `cluster_split` / `followup_flag` / `handoff`
live in the governance DB; `handoff_<hash>_<ts>.json` under `data/acquisition/handoffs/` is immutable;
`saved_view` holds UI prefs. The tracked `.githooks/pre-commit` sweeps `labels.json` +
`district_status.json` into every commit — on a fresh clone run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
(`GETTING_STARTED.md` §1b). Stage 4 needs poppler/tesseract/ghostscript (`GETTING_STARTED.md` §1a).

**Current status (2026-07-10):** the console runs the pipeline live through **`gate@7`**. The **"whittle
down open issues" hygiene campaign is fully CLOSED** — Batches 1–6 + #124 (arch-manifest/fitness-function
suite), all merged (PRs #177–#199, #206). **The four commandments** (Ian, 2026-07-09 — auditability the
north star, minimize-bad-data-at-scale ⇒ automation is a correctness REQUIREMENT not a convenience, tight
cash spend, best use of one person's time; posture: "as automated as is tolerable") now frame **epic
#209** (runtime guardrails for the manual→auto transition), whose **Phase 0/1 groundwork shipped
2026-07-09/10**: **#208** the canonical recall floor, enforced *inside* the re-ingest transaction (PR
#215 — a violation rolls back the whole re-ingest, not a post-hoc report); **#211/REQ-120** the
anti-survivorship exploration-quota's pure control-law core, tested + review-hardened (PR #216 — live
console wiring still deferred, intentionally: the audit's signal already exists via Ian's census-labeling
habit, so it ships *with* gate@5-auto, not before it); **#210/REQ-121** the gate-decision calibration log
— schema built (PR #217) **and wired live** at gate@5/6/7 (PR #218), so a shadow-mode audit corpus now
accrues forward from every human gate action. Every PR in this arc (like the hygiene campaign before it)
went through a max-effort adversarial review round that found real defects even in "just infrastructure"
work — see `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`'s two newest entries for the full lesson set.
**Next:** epic #209 Phase 2 (#212 group-aware non-inferiority promotion gate, #213 safe-promotion
machinery — no cash spend); then the live gate-mode (manual/auto) persistence + console toggle that both
Phase-1 guardrails' demote-hooks are waiting on (currently unbuilt — every gate is de-facto always-manual);
then epic #200's defect-prevention items (#201–#204) at discretion. Separately still open: a clean live
non-benchmark end-to-end pass of the hardened request loop (#122); Stage 8 (aggregate, not yet built —
#88/#89, and the natural home for gate@8's calibration hook once it exists); the Council Lab backlog
(#80/#81). Full detail: `PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE_2026-06.md` §11b (the complete guardrail design +
as-built detail), `STAGE5_FILTER_DESIGN_2026-06.md` §5a/§5b, `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (both campaign
entries).

## Current Data Years

**Current School Year:** 2025-26

### Data Year Strategy

| Data Type | Year | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Primary dataset | 2023-24 | NCES CCD enrollment/staffing |
| Bell schedules | 2025-26, 2024-25, 2023-24 | Any acceptable, search current first |
| COVID exclusion | 2019-20 through 2022-23 | Never use - abnormal schedules |

**Search Order:** 2025-26 → 2024-25 → 2023-24 (all post-COVID, interchangeable)

---

## Database Quick Reference

```bash
# Bell schedule count (source of truth)
python3 -c "
from infrastructure.database.connection import session_scope
from sqlalchemy import text
with session_scope() as s:
    print(s.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district_id) FROM bell_schedules')).scalar())
"

# Query enrichment status
python -c "
from infrastructure.database.connection import session_scope
from infrastructure.database.queries import print_enrichment_report
with session_scope() as session:
    print_enrichment_report(session)
"
```

**Key Tables:** `districts`, `bell_schedules`, `state_requirements`, `lct_calculations`, `state_district_crosswalk`

---

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Calculate LCT (recommended)
python3 infrastructure/scripts/analyze/calculate_lct_variants.py

# Interactive enrichment
python3 infrastructure/scripts/enrich/interactive_enrichment.py --state WI

# Run SEA integration tests
pytest tests/test_*_integration.py -v

# VERIFICATION - Run after enrichment!
python3 infrastructure/scripts/verify_enrichment.py --quick
```

### Architecture & code-exploration tools (use these to read/verify the codebase — REQ-098)
These are installed (dev-deps) and are the project's standard way to map dependencies and enforce
layering — reach for them before writing or verifying any "what depends on what" narrative:
```bash
lint-imports                 # enforce the acquisition layering contracts (.importlinter); expect "3 kept, 0 broken"
python3 -c "import grimp; g=grimp.build_graph('infrastructure'); \
  print(sorted(g.find_modules_directly_imported_by('infrastructure.acquisition.stage1_queue.queue_batch')))"
                             # grimp: query the real import graph (what a module imports / is imported by)
vulture infrastructure/acquisition    # dead-code sweep
cd infrastructure/scraper && npx depcruise --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs lib   # Node (.mjs) side
pytest tests/test_arch_manifest.py    # cross-boundary FITNESS functions vs arch-manifest.json (#124)
```
> **Caveat (the recurring lesson):** the import tools see **Python/Node imports only**. They do NOT see the
> *environmental* dependencies that often matter most — NCES CSV files read by path/year, **LCT DB
> tables** accessed via the ORM, `subprocess`/`claude -p` calls, OpenRouter API hosts. After the import
> graph, **read the code** for those edges. (Toolchain rationale: `PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE_AND_STATE_2026-06.md` §10.)
> **`arch-manifest.json` + `tests/test_arch_manifest.py` (#124) now close part of this gap:** the declared
> ground truth for the cross-boundary edges (external processes, guarded entry points, client↔server rule
> literals, stage receipts), enforced as fitness functions. **When you add such an edge, update the manifest**
> — that edit is the review surface, and the suite fails on an undeclared one.

## Critical Rules

1. **Docker Required**: Always use `docker-compose up -d` before database operations. Never use `brew services start postgresql` - the `.env` is configured for Docker's PostgreSQL container.
2. **COVID Data Exclusion**: Never use 2019-20 through 2022-23 data
3. **Security Blocks**: ONE-attempt rule for Cloudflare/WAF-protected districts
4. **Temporal Validation**: Data from multiple sources must span ≤3 years
5. **Raw Data**: Never modify files in `data/raw/`
6. **Data Verification**: ALWAYS verify data exists in database before claiming enrichment counts. Never trust dispatch documentation without database verification.
7. **Research before implementing**: When a task involves a non-trivial design decision, an unfamiliar
   failure mode, or a pattern this codebase hasn't established a convention for (state-machine/invariant
   design, a new library, a class of bug just hit), do a web search *before* writing code — not only
   after a bug or a code-review finding surfaces it. Goal: prevention over correction — spend a small,
   cheap search now to avoid a larger token/time cost fixing it later (a wrong implementation, a review
   round-trip, a CI failure). Cite what you found and how it shaped the approach, the same as any other
   research. This does not replace reading this codebase's own conventions first (CLAUDE.md, the
   `docs/technical-notes/` design notes, existing code in the area) — check those before an external
   search, since a local precedent usually beats a generic pattern.
