INTERPRETATION NOTES:
============================================================

- Higher LCT values indicate more theoretical one-on-one time
- 'teachers_only' is the most conservative K-12 measure
- 'teachers_elementary' vs 'teachers_secondary' shows level differences
- 'instructional' is recommended for policy discussions
- 'all' shows maximum resource investment
- Compare across scopes to understand staffing mix impact
