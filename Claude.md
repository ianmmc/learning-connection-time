# Claude Code Project Briefing: Instructional Minute Metric

## Project Mission

Transform abstract student-to-teacher ratios into tangible "Learning Connection Time" (LCT) metrics that tell the story of students getting shortchanged rather than teachers getting burdened.

**Core Formula:**
```
LCT = (Daily Instructional Minutes × Instructional Staff) / Student Enrollment
```

**Example:** A district with 5,000 students, 250 teachers, and 360 minutes/day of instruction:
- LCT = (360 × 250) / 5000 = **18 minutes per student per day**
- This reframes "20:1 student-teacher ratio" into a more tangible equity metric

**Goal:** Analyze data from the top 100-200 largest U.S. school districts to identify and communicate educational equity disparities.

---

## Project Context

### The "Reducing the Ratio" Initiative
This is part of a larger educational equity initiative. The LCT metric is designed to be a powerful rhetorical tool for policy discussions by making resource disparities visceral and understandable.

### Current Understanding of Limitations
We acknowledge the metric has methodological challenges:
- **Individualization fallacy**: Assumes all time could be one-on-one
- **Time-as-quality assumption**: More time ≠ automatically better
- **Averaging deception**: District metrics mask within-district disparities

### Evolution Strategy (6 Phases)
1. **Phase 1**: Basic LCT using state statutory requirements
2. **Phase 1.5 (Current)**: Enrich with actual bell schedules where available
3. **Phase 2**: Add teacher quality weights
4. **Phase 3**: Account for differentiated student needs
5. **Phase 4**: Include interaction quality dimensions
6. **Phase 5**: Opportunity-to-connect scores
7. **Phase 6**: Outcome-validated connection time

We're implementing Phase 1.5, which enhances basic LCT calculations with actual instructional time data from bell schedules rather than relying solely on state statutory minimums.

## Important: Current Date and Data Years

**Current Date:** December 21, 2025
**Current School Year:** 2025-26 (Fall 2025 - Spring 2026)

### Data Year Strategy

**For Historical Datasets:**
- **Primary campaign dataset:** 2023-24 (NCES CCD data, enrollment/staffing)
- **Legacy collection:** 2024-25 (preliminary bell schedule work)
- Federal and state datasets are typically 1-2 years behind current year

**For Bell Schedule Web Searches - Year Preference Order:**
1. **2025-26** (current year - most likely posted on websites)
2. **2024-25** (recent year - still commonly available, preferred over 2023-24)
3. **2023-24** (acceptable - matches primary dataset year)

Schools typically post current and recent year schedules. All three years (2025-26, 2024-25, 2023-24) represent normalized post-COVID operations and can be used interchangeably as proxies for instructional time.

**Example Search Queries:**
- ✅ "District Name bell schedule 2025-26" (try first - current year)
- ✅ "District Name daily schedule school day 2025-26" (alternative terms)
- ✅ "District Name start end times dismissal arrival 2025-26" (time-focused)
- ✅ "District Name bell schedule 2024-25" (fallback to prior year)
- ✅ "District Name bell schedule 2023-24" (last resort - acceptable)

**Effective Search Terms:**
Districts use varying terminology. Include multiple terms to maximize discovery:
- **Schedule terms:** "bell schedule", "daily schedule", "school day"
- **Time terms:** "start time", "end time", "dismissal time", "arrival time", "dismissal", "start", "end"
- **Combined:** Use multiple terms in one search for better results

**CRITICAL: COVID-Era Data Exclusion**
**❌ DO NOT USE data from these school years:**
- **2019-20** (COVID-19 shutdowns began March 2020)
- **2020-21** (Remote/hybrid learning, abnormal schedules)
- **2021-22** (Continued disruptions and transitions)
- **2022-23** (Transitional year, still recovering)

These years do not represent typical instructional time due to pandemic disruptions. If data from 2023-24 and later is unavailable, prefer **2018-19** (pre-COVID) over any COVID-era year.

**Rationale:** Bell schedules are generally stable across years under normal operations. Using recent schedules (2025-26, 2024-25, or 2023-24) as a proxy for 2023-24 instructional time is methodologically sound, while COVID-era schedules would introduce systematic bias toward artificially reduced instructional time.

## Key Technical Details

### Standard Schema for Normalized Data

After normalization, all district data follows this schema:

```python
{
    'district_id': str,           # Unique district identifier
    'district_name': str,         # District name
    'state': str,                 # Two-letter state code
    'enrollment': float,          # Total student enrollment
    'instructional_staff': float, # Number of instructional staff
    'total_staff': float,         # Total staff count (optional)
    'schools': float,             # Number of schools (optional)
    'year': str,                  # School year (e.g., "2023-24")
    'data_source': str,          # Source identifier (e.g., "nces_ccd")
}
```

### State Instructional Time Requirements

States have vastly different requirements (from `config/state-requirements.yaml`):
- **Texas**: 420 minutes/day (highest)
- **Utah**: 240 minutes/day for K-8 (lowest)
- **California**: 240-360 minutes depending on grade
- Default: 360 minutes if not specified

### Multi-Part File Handling

Many large datasets are split across multiple files with naming pattern:
- `filename_1.csv`, `filename_2.csv`, `filename_3.csv`, etc.

The `split_large_files.py` script automatically:
1. Detects files matching this pattern
2. Sorts by part number
3. Concatenates while preserving headers
4. Creates combined file with `_combined` suffix

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Always Start with Sample Data

```bash
# Create sample data for testing
python infrastructure/scripts/download/fetch_nces_ccd.py --year 2023-24 --sample

# Test the full pipeline (basic)
python pipelines/full_pipeline.py --year 2023-24 --sample

# Test with bell schedule enrichment
python pipelines/full_pipeline.py --year 2023-24 --sample --enrich-bell-schedules --tier 2
```

### 2. Process Real Data Incrementally

```bash
# Download full dataset
python infrastructure/scripts/download/fetch_nces_ccd.py --year 2023-24

# Enrich with bell schedules (optional, for top districts)
# NOTE: For manual enrichment, see docs/BELL_SCHEDULE_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md
python infrastructure/scripts/enrich/fetch_bell_schedules.py \
  data/processed/normalized/top_25_districts.csv \
  --tier 1 --year 2023-24

# Handle multi-part files if present
python infrastructure/scripts/extract/split_large_files.py data/raw/federal/nces-ccd/2023_24/

# Normalize to standard schema
python infrastructure/scripts/transform/normalize_districts.py \
  data/raw/federal/nces-ccd/2023_24/districts.csv \
  --source nces --year 2023-24

# Calculate LCT with summary and filtering (recommended)
python infrastructure/scripts/analyze/calculate_lct.py \
  data/processed/normalized/districts_2023_24_nces.csv \
  --summary --filter-invalid
```

### 3. Development Principles

- **Never modify raw data**: Always work with copies in processed/
- **Document lineage**: Scripts create `_lineage.yaml` files automatically
- **Test incrementally**: Validate at each pipeline stage
- **Write tests**: Add to `infrastructure/quality-assurance/tests/`
- **Log everything**: Use Python's logging module consistently

---

## Data Sources

### Priority Federal Sources

1. **NCES Common Core of Data (CCD)**
   - Annual data for all public schools/districts
   - Includes enrollment, staff counts, demographics
   - URL: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/
   - Best for: District-level metrics

2. **Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)**
   - Biennial survey
   - More detailed class-level data
   - Teacher assignments, class sizes
   - Best for: Fine-grained analysis

### Priority State Sources

Phased rollout starting with:
1. **California** - DataQuest API, excellent access
2. **Texas** - PEIMS data, comprehensive
3. **New York** - NYSED data portal
4. **Florida** - Growing population, good reporting

## Current Challenges & Opportunities

### Known Data Gaps

1. **Temporal Data Missing from Standards** ⭐ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
   - Bell schedules not in OneRoster ✅ Now collected via web scraping
   - Period duration not standardized ✅ Extracted from bell schedules where available
   - Actual vs. statutory time not tracked ✅ Actual time used for Tier 1 & 2 districts
   - Remaining limitation: Not all districts have publicly available schedules

2. **Multi-Part File Reality**
   - Large datasets often split by data providers
   - Our `split_large_files.py` handles this
   - Always check for `_1`, `_2`, etc. patterns

3. **State Variation**
   - Different data formats per state
   - Different instructional time requirements
   - Need custom normalization per state

4. **Data Quality Issues** ✅ ADDRESSED
   - Some districts report zero enrollment or staff (administrative units)
   - Occasional impossible ratios (more staff than students)
   - Invalid LCT values (exceeding available time)
   - ✅ Automated filtering now implemented (`--filter-invalid` flag)
   - ✅ Validation reports provide transparency
   - ✅ Publication-ready datasets exclude ~2-3% of invalid records

### Integration Opportunities

1. **OneRoster for Live Data**
   - Project owner has OneRoster integration work
   - Could supplement public data analysis
   - Direct SIS access for select districts

2. **React Prototype**
   - Visualization tool in development
   - Could display LCT calculations in real-time
   - See related project work

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Validate with Real Data
1. Download actual NCES CCD data for 2023-24
2. Test multi-part file handling on real splits
3. Validate normalization produces correct schema
4. Confirm LCT calculations match expectations

### Priority 2: Expand State Coverage
1. Research data access for California
2. Document their specific format in normalization script
3. Add California-specific column mappings
4. Test end-to-end with CA data

### Priority 3: Build District Profiles
1. Create district-level summary cards
2. Include comparison to state/national averages
3. Generate visualizations showing LCT distribution
4. Export to formats suitable for presentations

### Priority 4: Quality Assurance
1. Expand test coverage in `tests/`
2. Add integration tests for full pipeline
3. Validate against known ground truth districts
4. Document edge cases and handling

## Troubleshooting

### "Column not found" errors
- Check that input data matches expected schema
- Review column mappings in normalization script
- Use `--validate-only` flag to test without saving

### Memory issues
- Use `dask` for large files
- Process in chunks with pandas `chunksize`
- Consider PostgreSQL for very large datasets

### Multi-part files not detected
- Ensure naming follows `basename_N.ext` pattern
- Check pattern parameter: `--pattern "_"`
- Verify files are in same directory

---

## Getting Help

1. **Check script documentation**: All scripts have `--help` flags
2. **Review script README**: `infrastructure/scripts/README.md` has comprehensive examples
3. **Check test files**: Tests show expected usage patterns
4. **Review chat history**: `docs/chat-history/` has session context

**Data Quality Standards:**
- ✅ Only actual bell schedules counted in enrichment metrics
- ✅ All files use standardized JSON schema with elementary/middle/high breakdowns
- ✅ Source attribution in every file (method: automated_enrichment or human_provided)

### Legacy Dataset: 2023-24

**Wyoming Campaign:** 5 districts (separate tracking)
- Tracking file: `data/processed/normalized/enrichment_reference.csv`
- Note: 135 statutory fallback files excluded from counts (moved to tier3_statutory_fallback/)
- **Status**: Complete, archived dataset

### Infrastructure Optimizations (Dec 21-25, 2025)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Data optimization (88% token reduction via slim files)
- ✅ Process optimization (2.15-4.25M token savings)
- ✅ Lightweight enrichment reference file (90% token reduction per load)
- ✅ Batch enrichment framework with checkpoint/resume
- ✅ Real-time progress tracker (`enrichment_progress.py`)
- ✅ Smart candidate filtering (6,952 high-quality targets identified)
- ✅ Terminology standardization (`docs/TERMINOLOGY.md`)
- ✅ **PostgreSQL database migration** (Dec 25, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  - Migrated from JSON files to PostgreSQL 16 (Docker containerized)
  - 17,842 districts, 50 state requirements, 384 bell schedules (128 districts)
  - Query utilities for token-efficient data access
  - JSON export for backward compatibility
- ✅ **Docker containerization** (Dec 25, 2025)
  - PostgreSQL running in Docker container for portability
  - `docker-compose up -d` for instant setup
  - Persistent volumes for data safety
  - Same environment local → production (Supabase-ready)

### Known Limitations

1. ~~**Consolidated file size**: 41,624+ tokens~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** via PostgreSQL
   - Data now queried from database instead of loading full JSON
   - Export utility maintains backward compatibility

2. **Coverage**: 128 of 17,842 U.S. districts (0.72%)
   - 35 states with ≥3 districts (64% state coverage)
   - 43 states/territories represented
   - Focused on largest districts and strategic state-by-state sampling
   - Sufficient for robust equity analysis and methodology validation

### Campaign Strategy Notes

**Current Approach**: State-by-state enrichment with expanded candidate pool ⭐ UPDATED Dec 26, 2025

**Standard Operating Procedure (Option A):**
1. Process states in **ascending enrollment order** (from `state_enrichment_tracking.csv`)
2. For each state, query districts **ranked 1-9 by enrollment**
3. Attempt enrichment in rank order
4. **Stop when 3 successful** enrichments achieved
5. Mark any failed attempts for manual follow-up (`manual_followup_needed.json`)
6. Move to next state

**Why This Works:**
- First pass (ranks 1-3): ~44% success rate
- Expanded pool (ranks 4-9): ~83% success rate
- Combined (ranks 1-9): ~90% state completion in single pass
- Avoids context-switching overhead of revisiting states
- Token-efficient: single session per state in most cases

**Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Get districts ranked 1-9 by enrollment for a state
SELECT nces_id, name, enrollment
FROM districts
WHERE state = 'XX'
ORDER BY enrollment DESC
LIMIT 9;
```

**Python Workflow:**
```python
from infrastructure.database.connection import session_scope
from infrastructure.database.queries import add_bell_schedule

with session_scope() as session:
    add_bell_schedule(
        session,
        district_id="XXXXXXX",
        year="2025-26",
        grade_level="elementary",
        instructional_minutes=360,
        start_time="8:00 AM",
        end_time="3:00 PM",
        lunch_duration=30,
        method="web_scraping",
        confidence="high",
        schools_sampled=["School A", "School B"],
        source_urls=["https://..."],
        notes="District-wide schedule"
    )
```

**Evaluation Checkpoints:**
- Review progress every 5-10 states
- Track success rates by state and rank
- Adjust strategy if patterns emerge

**Legacy Approach** (still supported):
- User provides files in `data/raw/manual_import_files/{State}/{District Name (STATE)}/`
- Process using `infrastructure/scripts/utilities/batch_convert.py` for PDFs/HTML
- Create individual JSON files: `{district_id}_2024-25.json`

**Future Expansion Options**:
1. Continue state-by-state completion (current priority)
2. Target underrepresented regions as coverage expands
3. Manual follow-up for blocked districts after campaign completes
4. Systematic national coverage for policy impact

**Last Updated**: December 26, 2025
**Project Location**: `/Users/ianmmc/Development/learning-connection-time`
**Status**: Active enrichment campaign - State-by-state coverage expansion ✅
**Primary Data Store**: PostgreSQL database (learning_connection_time) ⭐ NEW
**Dataset**: Mixed (2023-24 legacy + 2024-25 + 2025-26 current campaign)
**Milestones**:
- ✅ Top 25 largest districts: 100% complete (25/25)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database migration complete (Dec 25, 2025)
- ✅ Docker containerization complete (Dec 25, 2025)
- ✅ Wyoming legacy data migrated (5 districts, 15 schedules from 2023-24)
- ✅ **35 states with ≥3 enriched districts** (64% of 55 states/territories) - as of Dec 26, 2025
- ✅ **128 total enriched districts** across 43 states/territories (0.72% of 17,842)
- ✅ **Option A process adopted** (Dec 26, 2025) - attempt ranks 1-9 per state, stop at 3 successful
- ✅ **South Carolina, Wisconsin, Minnesota campaigns complete** (Dec 26, 2025) - 9 districts enriched
**Key Additions**:
- Bell schedule search priority: 2025-26 > 2024-25 > 2023-24
- **CRITICAL**: COVID-era data exclusion (2019-20 through 2022-23) - use 2018-19 if needed
- **Data access**: Query database via `infrastructure/database/queries.py` for token efficiency
- **State tracking**: `data/processed/normalized/state_enrichment_tracking.csv`
- **Standard process**: Query ranks 1-9 per state, stop at 3 successful enrichments
